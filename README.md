Project Two - Diana Torres



# project overview 

I chose a verse from the Bible because recently, I have been struggling with a lot of anxiety and worries about my future. I have been going back and forth about if college, in general, is something I want to continue. But when I was talking to my pastor, he told me this verse. This defines community to me because I have always gone to church for as long as I can remember. Especially during these times where my mind feels so restless, I find peace sitting inside a church. My mind actually stays quiet and I can feel Godâ€™s hand giving me peace. Of course, I get back home and then I remember the workload I have to do but it's okay. But this verse is just encouraging that I should be invested in my work, doing the very best job I can. Church and God are my biggest pillars right now with just getting through with the day and having some place to feel okay. I like the ending to it as well because once we die, everything I did will be left on earth so it should be a good example of who I was. I specifically wanted to focus on this verse because of the reflief I felt when it was said to me. I'm a very emotional person, if you know me personally then you truly know I wear my heart on my sleeve. I even cried tears of joy when I finished this project because I have just been doubting myself and had been negative a lot.

# acknowldegements

I used and implemented into my website code from Jose Ochoa from the Project 2 Student Examples. I used their glow effect and the neon-animation on my 3 of my pages. I also used his info div boxes for all of my pages because it helped me organize everything neatly. Then I used the Animista animation which was called slide-bottom to my 2nd page. I left the copyright credit into my style sheet.
